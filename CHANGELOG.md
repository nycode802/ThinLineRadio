## Version 7.0

**Make sure to backup your config and your database before updating to Version 7.0.**

### Core Version 7.0 Features (Original Rdio Scanner Project)

- New database schema now compatible with PostgreSQL. 

**SQLite Support Removed:**
SQLite support has been removed in v7 due to fundamental architectural limitations that make it unsuitable for Rdio Scanner's production workloads, even in v6. SQLite suffers from:
- **Database locking issues**: SQLite uses file-level locking which causes frequent "database is locked" errors when multiple processes or concurrent operations attempt to access the database simultaneously. This is particularly problematic with Rdio Scanner's high-concurrency architecture where multiple clients, call ingestion, transcription processing, alert engines, and admin operations all need simultaneous database access.
- **SQL_BUSY errors**: Under load, SQLite frequently returns SQL_BUSY errors when write operations conflict with reads, causing call ingestion failures, search timeouts, and client connection issues. This was a persistent problem even in v6 with the simpler architecture.
- **Performance limitations**: SQLite is designed for single-user or low-concurrency applications. Rdio Scanner's real-time nature requires high-throughput database operations (hundreds of calls per minute, simultaneous client queries, alert processing, transcription storage) which SQLite cannot handle efficiently. The lack of proper connection pooling and concurrent write support creates severe bottlenecks.
- **No true concurrent writes**: SQLite only allows one writer at a time, which creates contention when multiple systems are ingesting calls, storing transcriptions, updating user preferences, and processing alerts simultaneously.
- **File-based architecture**: The file-based nature of SQLite makes it unsuitable for distributed or high-availability deployments, and creates I/O bottlenecks that proper database servers avoid through optimized memory management and connection pooling.

For production deployments, PostgreSQL is required and provides proper concurrent access, connection pooling, and performance characteristics needed for Rdio Scanner's real-time, multi-user architecture.
- New Delayed feature which allows to delay ingested audio broadcasting for a specified amount of minutes.
- New alert sounds that can be assigned to groups, tags, systems and talkgroups.
- New system and talkgroup types to help identify the radio system.
- Talkgroups can now be assigned to more than one group.
- LED colors can now be assigned to groups, tags, systems and talkgroups.
- Better call duplicates detection, thanks to the new database schema.
- Tags toggle removed in favor of multi groups assignment for talkgroups.
- AFS systems option remove and replace by system/talkgroup type provoice.
- Newer API while retaining backward compatility.
- Integrated web app migrated to Angular 15.
- Simplified talkgroup importation to a specific system.
- New /reset url path that allow reseting the user access code and talkgroups selection.
- New #UNITLBL metatag for dirwatch.

### BREAKING CHANGES SINCE V5

[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) is now distributed as a precompiled executable in a zip file, which also contains documentation on how it works.

The backend server has been completely rewritten in GO language. Therefore, all the subpackages used in v5 had to be replaced with new ones. These new subpackages do not necessarily have the same functionality as those of v5.

- No more polling mode for _dirwatch_, which in a way is a good thing as polling was disastrous for CPU consumption. The alternative is to install a local instance and use the downstream feature to feed your main instance.
- Due to the polling situation, the Docker version of Rdio Scanner doesn't have the dirwatch feature.
- Default database name changed from _database.sqlite_ to _rdio-scanner.db_. You will need to rename your database file with the new name if you want to convert it. Otherwise, a new database will be created.

_v6.0.1_

- Fixed button sound on select panel for TG (beep state inverted)
- Auto populate system units (issue #66)

_v6.0.2_

- Try to fix the SQL_BUSY error (issue #67).
- Fixed `-service stop` timing out before exiting.
- Drop the ApiKey uniqueness of the downstreams database table.

- The `rdioScannerCalls` table will be rebuilt, which can be pretty long on some systems.
- It is no longer possible to upload neither your TALKGROUP.CSV nor you ALIAS.CSV files to _Rdio Scanner_. Instead, you have to define them in the `server/config.json` file.
