# Change log

## Version 7.0 Beta 9.3 - Released TBD

### Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fixed bug where user alert preferences and FCM tokens were being cleared on config save**
  - Root cause #1: Database CASCADE DELETE constraints on `userAlertPreferences.userId` and `deviceTokens.userId` automatically deleted data when users were updated
  - Root cause #2: Migration in beta 9.2 only dropped constraints but didn't recreate them without CASCADE DELETE
  - When saving config, user records are updated, triggering CASCADE DELETE of all related alert preferences and FCM tokens
  - Database fix: Migration now properly recreates foreign key constraints WITHOUT CASCADE DELETE (defaults to NO ACTION)
  - Updated migration function `migrateRemoveUserAlertPreferencesCascadeDelete` to drop AND recreate constraints
  - Database constraints now prevent automatic deletion when parent records are updated
  - User alert preferences and FCM tokens now persist across all config save operations
  - Files modified: server/migrations.go

- **Fixed keyword list IDs becoming orphaned when deleting keyword lists or importing from Radio Reference**
  - Root cause #1: When deleting keyword lists via API, references in `userAlertPreferences.keywordListIds` JSON arrays weren't being cleaned up
  - Root cause #2: Radio Reference imports were deleting ALL keyword lists and recreating them with new auto-incremented IDs
  - Keyword lists are user-defined and have nothing to do with Radio Reference data, yet they were being wiped on every RR import
  - Migration `migrateFixKeywordListIds` would fix orphaned IDs on startup, but problems would recur after deletions or RR imports
  - Fixed #1: DELETE endpoint now cleans up references in all user alert preferences before deleting keyword list
  - Fixed #2: Radio Reference imports now skip keyword list processing entirely, preserving user's keyword lists and their IDs
  - Only full backup/restore operations (which include `keywordListId` field) will replace keyword lists with preserved IDs
  - Orphaned keyword list IDs no longer occur from deletions or Radio Reference imports
  - Files modified: server/api.go, server/admin.go

## Version 7.0 Beta 9.2 - Released TBD

### Enhancements

- **Enhanced API error logging with additional context (GitHub issue #88)**
  - Root cause: API errors like "Invalid credentials" and "Incomplete call data: no talkgroup" provided no details about source IP, endpoint, or user agent
  - Made troubleshooting difficult as admins couldn't identify where unauthorized access attempts or invalid API calls were coming from
  - Fixed: Added new `exitWithErrorContext()` function that logs comprehensive request details (source IP, HTTP method, endpoint path, user agent)
  - Handles proxy headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP) to capture real client IP behind proxies/load balancers
  - Updated critical API error paths: invalid credentials (login endpoints), incomplete call data (call upload)
  - Also enhanced admin login logging for failed attempts, rate limiting, and localhost-only violations
  - Logs now show format: "api: [error message] | IP=[client_ip] | Endpoint=[method path] | UserAgent=[agent]"
  - Example: "api: Invalid credentials | IP=192.168.1.100 | Endpoint=POST /api/user/login | UserAgent=Mozilla/5.0..."
  - Admin logs: "admin: Invalid login attempt | IP=127.0.0.1 | Endpoint=POST /api/admin/login | UserAgent=Chrome/120.0..."
  - Admins can now identify problematic API clients, unauthorized access attempts, and misconfigured upload systems
  - Files modified: server/api.go, server/admin.go

### Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fixed bug where importing sites/talkgroups from Radio Reference would wipe out all user alert preferences (INCOMPLETE FIX - see beta 9.3)**
  - Root cause: Database CASCADE DELETE constraints on `userAlertPreferences` table automatically deleted preferences when talkgroups were updated/deleted
  - When talkgroups are written to database, old ones are deleted and recreated, triggering CASCADE DELETE of all related user preferences
  - Database fix: Attempted to remove CASCADE DELETE foreign key constraints from `userAlertPreferences.systemId` and `userAlertPreferences.talkgroupId`
  - Client-side fix: Excluded `userAlertPreferences` and `deviceTokens` from regular config saves (only included in full imports)
  - Server-side fix: User alert preferences and device tokens are now only deleted/reimported during explicit full configuration imports
  - **NOTE: Migration was incomplete - only dropped constraints but didn't recreate them. Fixed properly in beta 9.3**
  - Files modified: server/postgresql.go, server/migrations.go, server/database.go, server/admin.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/config.component.ts

- **Fixed system alerts not clearing on first click (GitHub issue #96)**
  - Root cause: Frontend was using POST method but backend expected PUT for RESTful compliance
  - Alert dismissal required multiple clicks to work, especially on busy servers
  - Fixed: Updated backend to accept both POST and PUT methods for dismissing alerts
  - Updated frontend to use PUT method as originally intended
  - Files modified: server/admin.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts

- **Fixed per-system no-audio alert settings not saving reliably**
  - Root cause: Frontend was saving entire config JSON which caused race conditions on high-traffic servers (100+ calls/min)
  - Saving per-system settings would fail intermittently due to concurrent config modifications
  - Fixed: Added dedicated API endpoint `/api/admin/system-no-audio-settings` for atomic updates
  - Now updates only the specific system's settings without loading/saving entire config
  - Files modified: server/admin.go, server/main.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.ts

- **Fixed double lossy audio conversion degrading transcription quality (GitHub issue #91)**
  - Root cause: Audio was being converted twice through lossy codecs before transcription
  - Original flow: SDRTrunk MP3 (16kbps) → Opus/AAC conversion → WAV conversion for transcription
  - Each lossy conversion degrades audio quality, making transcription less accurate
  - Tone detection was already using original audio (before Opus conversion), but transcription was not
  - Fixed: Transcription now uses the original raw audio (MP3 from SDRTrunk) before Opus/AAC conversion
  - This avoids double lossy conversion and provides same quality audio to transcription as tone detection gets
  - New flow: SDRTrunk MP3 (16kbps) → WAV conversion for transcription (single conversion)
  - Added `OriginalAudio` and `OriginalAudioMime` fields to Call struct and TranscriptionJob struct
  - Controller stores original audio before encoding and passes it to transcription queue
  - Transcription worker now uses original audio, falling back to converted audio if original unavailable
  - Files modified: server/call.go, server/controller.go, server/transcription_queue.go

- **Fixed talkgroup CSV import inserting talkgroups in reverse order**
  - Root cause: CSV import component was using `unshift()` method which adds items to the beginning of the array
  - When importing a CSV file, each talkgroup was prepended to the list, resulting in reverse order
  - This made the talkgroups appear in opposite order from the CSV file when not sorting by ID or name
  - Fixed: Changed `unshift()` to `push()` to append talkgroups in correct order
  - Talkgroups now import in the same order as they appear in the CSV file
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/import-talkgroups/import-talkgroups.component.ts

- **Fixed audio playback duplication when toggling channels during livefeed (GitHub issue #93)**
  - Root cause: When user toggled systems/talkgroups in Channel Select while livefeed was running with backlog enabled, the client sent a new LivefeedMap to server
  - Server's `ProcessMessageCommandLivefeedMap()` always called `sendAvailableCallsToClient()` on every LivefeedMap update
  - This re-sent all backlog audio (e.g., 1 minute of prior calls) every time a channel was toggled
  - With hundreds of calls in the backlog, the queue would fill with duplicate transmissions
  - Fixed: Added `BacklogSent` flag to Client struct to track whether initial backlog has been sent for current livefeed session
  - Server now only sends backlog on initial livefeed start (when transitioning from all-off to any-on state)
  - Channel toggles during active livefeed no longer re-send backlog audio
  - Flag resets when livefeed is fully stopped (all channels off), allowing backlog to be sent again on next livefeed start
  - Users can now toggle channels without experiencing audio queue duplication
  - Files modified: server/client.go, server/controller.go

- **Fixed tag validation error when assigning manually created tags to talkgroups (GitHub issue #95)**
  - Root cause: After saving config, Angular's change detection wasn't properly updating child components with fresh data containing database-assigned IDs
  - When creating a new tag and saving, the server assigned an ID and returned the updated config, but form rebuilding with OnPush change detection didn't propagate to child components
  - Tag dropdown would show newly created tags but without IDs, causing "Tag required" error when selected
  - This only worked after manual browser refresh which fully reinitialized all components
  - Fixed: Page now automatically reloads after save to ensure all components get fresh data with database-assigned IDs (same as manual refresh)
  - Users can now create tags and immediately assign them after save completes
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/config.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/config.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/talkgroup/talkgroup.component.html

- **Fixed FFmpeg version detection for FFmpeg 8.0+ (GitHub issue #92)**
  - Root cause: Version detection regex only matched single-digit version numbers (e.g., 4.3)
  - FFmpeg 8.0.1+ versions failed regex pattern `([0-9])` which only captures 0-9, not multi-digit numbers
  - This caused server to incorrectly fall back to `dynaudnorm` filter instead of using `loudnorm` filter
  - Users saw warning "FFmpeg 4.3+ required for loudnorm filter" despite having FFmpeg 8.0.1 installed
  - Fixed: Updated regex pattern from `([0-9])\.([0-9])` to `([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)` to match multi-digit versions
  - Server now correctly detects FFmpeg 8.0.1, 10.2.1, and other multi-digit versions
  - Audio normalization now uses proper `loudnorm` filter (EBU R128 standard) instead of fallback `dynaudnorm`
  - Files modified: server/ffmpeg.go

- **Fixed talkgroup blacklist not working properly**
  - Root cause: Admin panel was using wrong field (`id` - database primary key) instead of `talkgroupRef` (radio reference ID) when adding to blacklist
  - Server blacklist checking uses `talkgroupRef` to match incoming calls, but admin was storing database IDs in blacklist string
  - This caused blacklisted talkgroups to persist and continue receiving calls after being blacklisted
  - Fixed: Changed `blacklistTalkgroup()` method to use `talkgroup.value.talkgroupRef` instead of `talkgroup.value.id`
  - Blacklisted talkgroups are now properly rejected when calls arrive
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts, rdio-scanner-master/client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts

- **Fixed talkgroup pagination breaking bulk actions (GitHub issue #97)**
  - Root cause: Bulk action methods were using paginated indices (0-49 for each page) directly on the full talkgroups array
  - When selecting talkgroups on page 2+, bulk actions (Assign Tag/Group) were applied to wrong talkgroups at those positions on page 1
  - Example: Selecting item 5 on page 2 (actual index 55) would apply action to item 5 on page 1 (actual index 5)
  - Fixed: Added `getFullTalkgroupIndex()` helper method to map paginated index to full array index
  - Updated `toggleTalkgroupSelection()` and `isTalkgroupSelected()` to use full array indices for selection tracking
  - Bulk actions now correctly apply to the talkgroups selected on any page
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts

## Version 7.0 Beta 9.1 - Released TBD

### Breaking Changes

- **Push notifications migrated from OneSignal to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
  - Scanner server now uses FCM tokens for push notifications instead of OneSignal player IDs
  - Device registration endpoint updated to accept `fcm_token` and `push_type` fields
  - Legacy OneSignal tokens (`token` field) automatically fallback for backward compatibility
  - **Test push notifications**: Now use per-device sound preferences from database
  - **Platform-specific sound handling**: iOS devices receive sound names without extensions; Android devices receive sound with `.wav` extensions
  - **Bug fix**: Scanner server no longer overwrites platform-specific sounds - each platform (iOS/Android) now uses its own device's sound preference
  - Files modified: server/push_notification.go

## Version 7.0 Beta 9 - Released TBD

### Bug Fixes

- **Relay Server: Temporarily bypassed push notification subscription validation**
  - Temporary fix to allow all push notifications through without any validation
  - Bypasses both database checks and subscription validation due to app sync account sign-out issues
  - All player IDs are now passed directly to OneSignal without validation
  - OneSignal will handle filtering of invalid player IDs on their end
  - Users can't get a player ID until they subscribe in the mobile app anyway, so validation is redundant
  - Original validation logic (database checks and subscription verification) preserved in comments for easy restoration
  - TODO: Re-enable validation once app sync account issues are resolved
  - Files modified: relay-server/internal/api/api.go

- **Fixed talkgroup sorting not persisting properly**
  - Root cause: Admin panel FormArray was not being reordered to match display order
  - When saving config after modifying other sections, talkgroups were saved in database ID order instead of custom sort order
  - Client-side fix: FormArray is now reordered to match display order (sorted by Order field) on load
  - Server-side fix: Changed all talkgroup sorts to stable sorts with secondary sort key (talkgroup ID) to prevent random shuffling
  - AutoPopulate fix: New talkgroups now get Order = max(existing orders) + 1 instead of 0, preventing them from jumping to the top
  - Fixed typo in talkgroup.ToMap() where Order field was incorrectly mapped as "talkgroup" instead of "order"
  - Talkgroup custom sort order now persists correctly across saves, page refreshes, and server restarts
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts, server/controller.go, server/talkgroup.go, server/system.go

- **Fixed new talkgroups/systems auto-enabling for all users (GitHub issue #85)**
  - Root cause: Web client's `rebuildLivefeedMap()` was defaulting new talkgroups to enabled if their group/tag wasn't explicitly Off
  - This caused newly created or auto-populated talkgroups to automatically appear in all users' live feeds
  - **Web client fix**: New talkgroups now default to `active: false` in livefeed map, requiring users to manually enable them in Channel Select
  - **Mobile app**: Already correctly defaulted new talkgroups to disabled state (`false`) in `_mergeTalkgroupStates()`
  - Users must now explicitly enable new talkgroups/systems before they appear in live feed
  - Prevents unexpected audio from new sources users haven't selected
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/rdio-scanner.service.ts

- **Fixed system no-audio alerts foreign key constraint error**
  - Root cause: System-generated no-audio alerts were passing 0 for `createdBy` field instead of NULL
  - This violated the foreign key constraint requiring `createdBy` to reference a valid user or be NULL
  - Fix: Changed `createdBy` value from 0 to NULL for system-generated alerts
  - Error message: `ERROR: insert or update on table "systemAlerts" violates foreign key constraint "systemAlerts_createdBy_fkey" (SQLSTATE 23503)`
  - Files modified: server/system_alert.goR

### New Features

- **Per-system no-audio alert configuration with simplified monitoring**
  - Replaced complex adaptive monitoring with simple per-system threshold configuration
  - Each system now has individual "No Audio Alerts" toggle and threshold (minutes) setting
  - Configured in Admin → System Health → Per-System No Audio Settings
  - Removed: Adaptive threshold calculation, historical data analysis, multipliers, time-of-day learning
  - New simple logic: Alert if system hasn't received audio in X minutes (configurable per-system)
  - Defaults: Enabled with 30-minute threshold for all systems
  - Global "No Audio Alerts Enabled" toggle still acts as master switch
  - Monitoring runs every 5 minutes and checks each enabled system
  - Files modified: server/system.go, server/postgresql.go, server/migrations.go, server/system_alert.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.html

- **Per-talkgroup exclusion from preferred site detection**
  - New "Exclude from Preferred Site Detection" option for individual talkgroups
  - Useful for interop/patched talkgroups that receive calls from multiple physical P25 systems
  - When enabled, talkgroup bypasses advanced duplicate detection and uses legacy time-based detection
  - Prevents unnecessary delays for talkgroups that can originate from sites outside preferred site configuration
  - Configured in Admin → Config → Systems → Talkgroups
  - Files modified: server/talkgroup.go, server/postgresql.go, server/migrations.go, server/controller.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/talkgroup/talkgroup.component.html

- **Automatic site identification by frequency**
  - System automatically determines which site a call originated from by matching call frequency against configured site frequencies
  - New `GetSiteByFrequency()` method searches within a system's sites for frequency matches
  - Uses 10 kHz tolerance (0.01 MHz) for frequency matching to account for variations
  - Applies during call ingestion and before database write
  - Only searches within the specific system the call belongs to
  - Populates `siteRef` field automatically when not provided by upload source
  - Files modified: server/site.go, server/call.go, server/controller.go

- **Advanced duplicate call detection system with intelligent site and API key prioritization**
  - Introduces two duplicate detection modes: Legacy (time-based only) and Advanced (site + frequency + API key aware)
  - **Legacy Mode**: Original behavior - rejects duplicate calls within configurable time window
  - **Advanced Mode**: Enhanced detection using preferred sites, frequency validation, and API key enforcement
  - **Preferred Sites**: Mark sites as preferred; calls from preferred sites are accepted immediately and cancel queued secondary site calls
  - **Secondary Site Queueing**: Calls from non-preferred sites are held for configurable time (default 2 seconds); automatically processed if no preferred site call arrives
  - **Preferred API Keys**: Assign preferred upload API keys to systems or talkgroups; preferred API key calls are prioritized over others
  - **Frequency Validation**: Sites can have configured frequencies for validation in advanced mode
  - **Smart Fallback**: Automatically falls back to legacy time-based detection if advanced configuration (sites, API keys) is not configured
  - **Separate Time Windows**: Independent configurable time frames for legacy and advanced modes
  - **Call Queue System**: New intelligent queueing system for delayed call ingestion with automatic cancellation
  - Configuration: Admin → Config → Options → Duplicate Call Detection
  - Files added: server/call_queue.go
  - Files modified: server/controller.go, server/call.go, server/api.go, server/options.go, server/defaults.go, server/migrations.go, server/site.go, server/system.go, server/talkgroup.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/options/options.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/talkgroup/talkgroup.component.html

- **Site configuration enhancements with P25 system support**
  - **Site ID as string**: Changed from numeric to string format to preserve leading zeros (e.g., "001", "021", "050")
  - **RFSS field**: Added Radio Frequency Sub-System ID field for P25 Phase 2 systems
  - **Frequencies array**: Sites can now store multiple frequencies for frequency validation in advanced duplicate detection
  - **Preferred site flag**: Mark one site per system as preferred for advanced duplicate detection
  - Backward compatibility: Existing numeric site IDs automatically converted to strings during migration
  - Database migration handles type conversion from INTEGER to TEXT for siteRef column
  - Files modified: server/site.go, server/migrations.go, server/call.go, server/api.go, server/dirwatch.go, server/parsers.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/site/site.component.html

- **Radio Reference import improvements with comprehensive state persistence**
  - **Full state persistence**: All selections, loaded data, and filters automatically saved and restored across page reloads
  - **Persistent data**: Import type, target system, country, state, county, selected system, categories, talkgroups, and sites
  - **Site import enhancements**: Added site selection with checkboxes, pagination (25/50/100/250 per page), and bulk selection options
  - **Frequency import**: Sites imported from Radio Reference now include all frequencies from the siteFreqs data
  - **RFSS import**: RFSS (Radio Frequency Sub-System) values are now imported and assigned to sites
  - **Improved site review**: Separate review table for sites showing RFSS, Site ID, Name, County, Latitude, Longitude, and Frequencies
  - **Site filtering**: Search sites by ID, name, or county with real-time filtering
  - **Clear saved state**: Added button to manually clear saved state if needed
  - **Better UX**: No need to re-query dropdowns or reselect options when returning to the import page
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/radio-reference-import/radio-reference-import.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/radio-reference-import/radio-reference-import.component.html, server/radioreference.go

### New Features

- **Simplified user registration settings for better UX**
  - Removed confusing "Public Registration Mode" sub-option dropdown (Codes Only / Email Invites Only / Both)
  - Public registration now defaults to supporting both codes and email invites by default
  - Cleaner, more intuitive admin interface with fewer configuration steps
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/user-registration/user-registration.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/user-registration/user-registration.component.ts

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed tone detection for overlapping two-tone paging sequences**
  - Relaxed sequencing requirements to support overlapping tones (common in two-tone paging)
  - Changed from requiring "B-tone must end after A-tone ends" to "B-tone must start after A-tone starts"
  - Now properly detects both sequential tones (A then B) and overlapping tones (A+B simultaneously)
  - Allows B-tone to start anytime during A-tone's duration (full overlap support)
  - Files modified: server/tone_detector.go

- **Improved tone detection for closely-spaced frequencies**
  - Added local maximum (peak) detection to FFT analysis
  - Only processes local maxima instead of all bins above threshold
  - Better separates closely-spaced tones (e.g., 556 Hz and 598 Hz with 42 Hz separation)
  - Prevents false merging of distinct simultaneous tones
  - Files modified: server/tone_detector.go

- **Fixed tone tolerance calculation in debug output**
  - Corrected tolerance calculation from `frequency * tolerance` to `tolerance * 500 Hz`
  - Debug output now shows accurate tolerance values matching actual detection logic
  - Example: 0.04 tolerance now correctly displays as ±20 Hz instead of ±22.24 Hz (for 556 Hz tone)
  - Files modified: server/tone_detector.go

- **Fixed SQL error when inserting calls with empty siteRef**
  - Converts string `siteRef` to integer before database insertion
  - Defaults to 0 when siteRef is empty or invalid
  - Resolves "syntax error at or near )" error in PostgreSQL
  - Files modified: server/call.go

- **Fixed admin purge functionality display issues**
  - "Purge All Logs" button now correctly shows it only deletes logs (not logs and calls)
  - "Purge All Calls" button now correctly shows it only deletes calls (not calls and logs)  
  - Clarified warning text to state each button only affects its specific data type
  - Reduced confirmation steps from 3 to 1 (single typed confirmation with full warning text)
  - Split purging state into separate `purgingCalls` and `purgingLogs` flags
  - Prevents both buttons showing "Purging..." when only one operation is active
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/purge-data/purge-data.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/purge-data/purge-data.component.html

- **Fixed web app display after transmission ends**
  - Talkgroup description and call info now properly clear when transmission finishes
  - "SCANNING" animation displays correctly when live feed is active and no call is playing
  - Finished call immediately moves to "Last 10 Transmissions" history
  - All call display variables reset to defaults (system, tag, talkgroup, unit, etc.)
  - Prevents stale call information from remaining on screen
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/main/main.component.ts

- **Enhanced user registration and login experience with improved password security**
  - Email addresses are now automatically converted to lowercase in all forms (registration, login, forgot password) to prevent case-sensitivity issues
  - Lowercase conversion happens both as users type and when forms are submitted
  - Added prominent email verification notice after successful registration with visual emphasis
  - Users are now clearly directed to check their email inbox (and spam folder) for the verification link
  - Email verification notice appears in both standalone registration page and main auth screen
  - **Added special character requirement to passwords for improved security**
  - Password requirements now include: 8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
  - Fixed password validation error overflow by displaying all missing requirements in a single compact line
  - Error format: "Missing: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char" (only shows what's missing)
  - Prevents text overflow into confirm password field with comma-separated inline format
  - "Passwords do not match" error now correctly appears only on the confirm password field
  - Applied to all authentication forms: user registration, user login, group admin login, and password reset
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/user-registration/user-registration.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/user-registration/user-registration.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/user-login/user-login.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/user-login/user-login.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/auth-screen/auth-screen.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/auth-screen/auth-screen.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/group-admin/group-admin-login.component.ts

- **Restored configurable Whisper transcription worker pool size with safety warnings**
  - Re-added worker pool size configuration for Whisper API transcription (previously removed in Beta 8)
  - Users with sufficient VRAM (8GB+) can now run multiple concurrent Whisper workers for faster transcription processing
  - Default remains at 1 worker for safety and stability
  - **Prominent warnings added in admin UI** about potential transcription failures when using multiple workers with insufficient resources
  - Recommended approach: Start with 1 worker, monitor for failures, and increase only if system has adequate VRAM
  - Cloud providers (Azure, Google, AssemblyAI) can typically handle 3-5+ workers without issues
  - Worker pool size configurable from 1-10 workers with provider-specific hints in UI
  - Configuration: Admin → Config → Options → Transcription Settings → Worker Pool Size
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/options/options.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, server/transcription_queue.go

- **Configurable loudness normalization presets with multiple loudness targets**
  - Replaced basic/loud normalization with four industry-standard loudness presets
  - **Conservative (-16 LUFS)**: Broadcast TV/radio standard (EBU R128), preserves high dynamic range, safest for all content
  - **Standard (-12 LUFS)**: Modern streaming standard (YouTube, Spotify), 4 dB louder than conservative, recommended default
  - **Aggressive (-10 LUFS)**: Dispatcher/public safety optimized, 6 dB louder with compressed dynamics for consistent volume
  - **Maximum (-8 LUFS)**: Maximum loudness, 8 dB louder than conservative, heavily compressed with minimal dynamics
  - **Bidirectional normalization**: Automatically boosts quiet channels AND reduces loud channels to target level for consistent listening experience
  - **EBU R128 compliant**: Uses FFmpeg's `loudnorm` filter based on broadcast industry standards (LUFS = Loudness Units relative to Full Scale)
  - **Dynamic range control**: Each preset balances loudness target with appropriate dynamic range preservation (LRA values from 11 to 5)
  - **True peak limiting**: Prevents clipping and distortion with appropriate headroom for each loudness level
  - **Enhanced over-modulated signal handling**: Added pre-limiter (`alimiter`) before loudnorm to catch extreme peaks, significantly improves handling of hot/distorted audio
  - **Linear mode processing**: Uses linear mode (`linear=true`) for better quality and more accurate normalization
  - **Dual mono optimization**: Optimized for mono scanner audio sources (`dual_mono=true`)
  - **Fallback for older FFmpeg**: Automatically falls back to `dynaudnorm` filter if FFmpeg < 4.3 (with user warning to upgrade)
  - Solves common issue where some channels are naturally quieter and hard to hear even with normalization
  - Fixes reported issue where over-modulated signals weren't being properly reduced to target levels
  - Provides flexibility for different use cases: monitoring (conservative), general listening (standard), dispatch operations (aggressive/maximum)
  - Admin UI includes helpful descriptions and hints explaining how normalization affects both quiet and loud channels
  - Configuration: Admin → Config → Options → Audio Conversion (select from dropdown)
  - Files modified: server/options.go, server/ffmpeg.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/options/options.component.html

### Performance Improvements

- **Admin systems and units page performance enhancements**
  - **Pagination**: Systems, talkgroups, units, and sites now display in pages of 50 items each
  - **Search functionality**: Added search bars to filter by label, name, or ID for instant results
  - **Cached sorting**: Optimized sorting algorithms to prevent redundant array operations on every change detection
  - **Reduced DOM nodes**: Only renders visible items per page, dramatically improving load times and responsiveness
  - **Real-time filtering**: Search results update instantly with item counts displayed
  - **Backward navigation**: Pagination controls include first/previous/next/last page buttons
  - Significantly improves admin interface performance for systems with hundreds or thousands of talkgroups/units
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/systems.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/systems.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.html

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed System Health Alert settings save failure (Issue #82)**
  - Added missing database migration for system health alert option keys
  - Users upgrading from older versions were missing required options table entries, causing 500 errors when saving settings
  - Migration now initializes all 16 system health alert options with default values if they don't exist
  - Fixes: systemHealthAlertsEnabled, transcriptionFailureAlertsEnabled, toneDetectionAlertsEnabled, noAudioAlertsEnabled, and related threshold/window/repeat settings
  - Migration runs automatically on server startup for existing installations
  - Issue reported: https://github.com/Thinline-Dynamic-Solutions/ThinLineRadio/issues/82
  - Files modified: server/migrations.go, server/database.go

- **Fixed Radio Reference site frequency parsing**
  - Corrected XML parsing to extract frequencies from `<siteFreqs><item><freq>` nodes
  - Frequencies are now properly parsed and included in site data from Radio Reference API
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging frequency extraction
  - Files modified: server/radioreference.go

- **Fixed frequency data type in site imports**
  - Corrected frequency storage format from strings to numbers for proper database handling
  - Frequencies now correctly saved as JSON array of float64 values
  - Resolves issue where frequencies appeared in import preview but disappeared after save
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/radio-reference-import/radio-reference-import.component.ts

### Database Changes

- Added `rfss` column to sites table (INTEGER, default 0)
- Changed `siteRef` column type from INTEGER to TEXT to preserve leading zeros
- Added `frequencies` column to sites table (TEXT, JSON array of floats)
- Added `preferred` column to sites table (BOOLEAN, default false)
- Added `preferredApiKeyId` column to systems table (INTEGER, nullable)
- Added `preferredApiKeyId` column to talkgroups table (INTEGER, nullable)
- Added `advancedDetectionTimeFrame` column to options table (INTEGER, default 1000)
- Migration automatically converts existing numeric siteRef values to strings

### Technical Notes

- Call queue system uses in-memory storage with timer-based expiration and cancellation
- Advanced duplicate detection checks database for existing calls before queueing
- Preferred site/API key calls bypass queue and immediately cancel any pending secondary calls
- Secondary calls are automatically processed after timeout if no preferred call arrives
- Site ID string format supports any text format (recommended: zero-padded decimals like "001")
- Frequency validation in advanced mode requires both site frequencies to be configured

## Version 7.0 Beta 8 - Released TBD

### New Features

- **Universal dispatch tone removal for transcription**
  - Added automatic detection and removal of ALL dispatch tones before transcription (200-5000Hz range)
  - Prevents Whisper hallucinations caused by two-tone sequential, quick call, and long tone paging systems
  - Works on all audio regardless of whether tone detection is enabled for the talkgroup
  - Detects sustained tones using FFT analysis with dynamic noise floor estimation
  - Removes detected tone segments using ffmpeg while preserving voice audio
  - Minimum tone duration: 500ms (catches all typical dispatch tones)
  - Skips transcription if less than 2 seconds of voice audio remains after tone removal
  - Provides detailed logging: detected tones with frequencies, durations, and removal status
  - Significantly improves transcription quality by eliminating tone-induced hallucination phrases
  - Files modified: server/tone_detector.go, server/transcription_queue.go

- **AssemblyAI word boost support for improved transcription accuracy**
  - Added word boost/keyterms feature for AssemblyAI transcription provider
  - Allows administrators to provide a list of words or phrases to improve recognition accuracy

  - Files modified: server/options.go, server/transcription_provider.go, server/transcription_assemblyai.go, server/transcription_queue.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/config.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/options/options.component.html

- **Enhanced transcripts tab with filtering and search capabilities**
  - Added comprehensive filtering controls to the Transcripts tab in the Alerts UI
  - Filter by system: Dropdown to filter transcripts by specific radio system
  - Filter by talkgroup: Dropdown to filter transcripts by specific talkgroup (filtered by selected system)
  - Filter by date range: Date inputs to filter transcripts by "From" and "To" dates
  - Search functionality: Text search bar to find specific words or phrases within transcript text
  - Search highlighting: Matching search terms are highlighted in yellow within displayed transcripts
  - Clear filters button: Quick reset of all filter criteria
  - Real-time filtering: Filters apply immediately as selections change
  - Backend API enhancements: Added support for systemId, talkgroupId, dateFrom, dateTo, and search query parameters
  - Proper systemRef/talkgroupRef resolution: Backend correctly resolves radio reference IDs to database IDs for filtering
  - Files modified: server/api.go (TranscriptsHandler), client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/alerts/alerts.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/alerts/alerts.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/alerts/alerts.component.scss, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/alerts/alerts.service.ts

- **Whisper transcription worker optimization - single worker configuration**
  - Removed configurable worker pool size option for Whisper transcription
  - Whisper API provider (local Whisper) now always uses exactly 1 worker
  - Testing showed that using 1 worker eliminated all transcription failures
  - Multiple workers were causing race conditions and failures with local Whisper
  - Other transcription providers (Azure, Google, AssemblyAI) continue to use configurable workers
  - Worker pool size UI field removed from Admin → Options → Transcription settings
  - Files modified: server/transcription_queue.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/options/options.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts

- **Configurable repeat alert timing for system health monitoring**
  - Added individual repeat interval settings for each alert type (Transcription Failures, Tone Detection Issues, No Audio Received)
  - Administrators can now configure how often alerts repeat when issues persist
  - Default values: 60 minutes for transcription and tone detection alerts, 30 minutes for no audio alerts
  - Configuration available in Admin → System Health → Additional Settings column for each alert type
  - Prevents alert spam by allowing customization of repeat frequency per alert category
  - Files modified: server/options.go, server/defaults.go, server/admin.go, server/system_alert.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts

- **Enhanced system alerts display with intelligent grouping and management**
  - Redesigned system alerts interface with professional category-based grouping
  - Alerts are now organized by type: "No Audio Received", "Tone Detection Issues", "Transcription Failures", and "Other Alerts"
  - Each group displays alert count badge for quick overview
  - Removed technical clutter: System IDs, raw JSON data, and technical metadata hidden from display
  - Individual alert dismissal: Each alert has a dismiss button (X icon) in the header
  - Bulk dismissal: "Clear All" button for each alert group to dismiss all alerts in a category at once
  - Confirmation dialogs: Prevent accidental dismissals with clear confirmations showing alert counts
  - Success notifications: Snackbar feedback when alerts are dismissed (individual or bulk)
  - Improved visual hierarchy: Group headers with clear categorization, better spacing and organization
  - Active alerts only: Statistics and displays only show non-dismissed alerts
  - Enhanced description for No Audio monitoring: Updated to "Intelligent adaptive monitoring: Continuously analyzes historical audio patterns by time of day, learns normal activity baselines, and dynamically adjusts alert thresholds to reduce false positives while maintaining sensitivity to genuine issues"
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.scss, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts

- **Purge logs and calls from admin UI with selective deletion support**
  - Added purge functionality to Admin → Tools → Purge Data section
  - **Purge All**: Delete all logs or all calls with triple confirmation (warning dialog, final confirmation, typed confirmation)
  - **Selective Delete**: Search and filter logs/calls, then select specific items for deletion
  - **Logs Management**: Search by date, level (info/warn/error), sort order; select individual items or batches
  - **Calls Management**: Search by date, system, talkgroup, sort order; select individual items or batches
  - **Selection Options**: "Select All on Page" (current 10 items), "Select All in Batch" (current 200 items), "Deselect All"
  - Pagination support: Navigate through results while maintaining selections
  - Confirmation dialogs: Requires confirmation before deleting selected items
  - Visual feedback: Selected count displayed, success/error notifications
  - Backend API: `/api/admin/purge` endpoint accepts `{type: 'calls'|'logs', ids?: number[]}` for selective or bulk deletion
  - Admin authentication required with localhost restriction (same as other admin endpoints)
  - Files modified: server/call.go, server/log.go, server/admin.go, server/main.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.module.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/purge-data/*
  - Files added: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/tools/purge-data/purge-data.component.ts, purge-data.component.html, purge-data.component.scss

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed handling of unknown radio IDs from Trunk Recorder**
  - Trunk Recorder sends -1 for transmissions where the radio ID could not be determined (no value over the air or control channel)
  - Previously, -1 was being converted to an unsigned integer (18446744073709551615), causing database insertion errors
  - Error message: "bigint out of range (SQLSTATE 22003)" when attempting to insert call units
  - Solution: Added validation to skip negative source IDs before converting to unsigned integers
  - Unknown transmissions (src: -1) are now gracefully ignored instead of causing database errors
  - Affects all parsing methods: Trunk Recorder srcList, generic sources/units, and unit field
  - Files modified: server/parsers.go

### Changes

- **Talkgroups with tone detection now transcribe short audio clips after tone removal**
  - Previously, calls with less than 2 seconds of audio remaining after tone removal were skipped
  - Now, if a talkgroup has tone detection enabled, short clips are transcribed regardless of remaining duration
  - This ensures important dispatch messages aren't missed even if they're brief after tones are removed
  - Applies to both the pre-queue duration check and the transcription worker check
  - Example: "RESPOND CODE 3" after tone removal might only be 1.5 seconds but is now transcribed
  - Files modified: server/controller.go, server/transcription_queue.go

- **Removed emojis from all email subjects and body content to reduce spam marking**
  - Emojis are automatically stripped from all email subjects and body text (both HTML and plain text)
  - Improves email deliverability by avoiding spam filters that flag emoji-heavy emails
  - Applies to all email types: verification, password reset, invitations, transfers, and test emails
  - Works with all email providers: SendGrid, Mailgun, and SMTP
  - Emoji removal uses comprehensive regex patterns covering all major emoji ranges
  - Files modified: server/email.go

- **Opus codec is now the default for new audio recordings**
  - Changed default from M4A/AAC to Opus codec for 50% storage savings
  - Provides superior voice quality at lower bitrates (16 kbps Opus vs 32 kbps AAC)
  - Can be disabled in `thinline-radio.ini` by setting `opus = false` to revert to M4A/AAC
  - Only affects NEW calls - existing calls remain unchanged
  - Migration tool remains optional (set `opus_migration = true` in INI to convert existing audio)
  - Browser and mobile app compatibility: Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari 14+, Android 5.0+, iOS 11+
  - Files modified: server/config.go

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed playback sort order and date filtering behavior**
  - Fixed inconsistent behavior when selecting a specific date in playback mode
  - When a date is selected, calls now always start from that date forward (>= selected date)
  - Sort order now correctly controls display order: "Newest First" shows most recent calls first (DESC), "Oldest First" shows oldest calls first (ASC)
  - Previously, "Newest First" with a selected date would show calls before the selected date (backwards in time)
  - Now both sort orders show calls from the selected date forward, just in different order
  - Mobile app: Fixed reversed sort order labels that displayed "Newest First" when actually showing oldest first
  - Improves intuitive behavior: selecting a date means "show me calls from this point forward"
  - Files modified: server/call.go, ThinlineRadio-Mobile/lib/screens/playback/playback_screen.dart

- **Fixed foreign key constraint violation when creating pre-alerts for tone detection**
  - Fixed "ERROR: insert or update on table 'alerts' violates foreign key constraint" error
  - Pre-alerts are now instant notifications only and are not saved to the database
  - Removed unnecessary database lookups and insert operations for pre-alerts
  - Pre-alerts now send immediately when tones are detected without waiting for call to be saved
  - Improves pre-alert delivery speed and eliminates race condition errors
  - Files modified: server/alert_engine.go, server/controller.go

- **Fixed authorization error when dismissing system alerts from admin UI**
  - Fixed "API unauthorized" error when clicking "Clear All" or individual dismiss buttons in System Health
  - Updated alert dismissal to use admin token authentication instead of WebSocket client authentication
  - Added POST handler to `/admin/systemhealth` endpoint for dismissing alerts

- **Fixed pending tones never attaching to voice calls due to timestamp mismatch**
  - Critical fix: Pending tone timestamps were using processing time instead of actual call transmission time
  - This caused voice calls to be incorrectly rejected as "came before pending tones" even when they came after
  - Example: Tone call at 12:00:00.000, processed and stored at 12:00:01.200, voice call at 12:00:00.500 would be rejected
  - Now uses `call.Timestamp` (radio transmission time) instead of `time.Now()` (processing time) for pending tones
  - Ensures timestamp comparisons accurately reflect the actual sequence of radio transmissions
  - Fixes issue where pending tones would lock/unlock properly but never attach to any voice calls
  - Files modified: server/controller.go (storePendingTones function)
  - Allows administrators to dismiss individual alerts or bulk dismiss alert groups
  - Files modified: server/admin.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/admin.service.ts

- **Fixed UI text cutoff issues in system health settings**
  - Fixed "Repeat Interval" label text being cut off on Transcription Failures and Tone Detection Issues rows
  - Increased field width from 140px to 160px for repeat interval dropdowns
  - Improved label wrapper CSS to allow text to wrap and display fully
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.html, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/system-health/system-health.component.scss

- **Fixed critical data integrity bug with keyword lists and user alert preferences**
  - Fixed destructive bug where keyword lists and user alert preferences were deleted and recreated on ANY admin config save
  - Root cause: Admin config handler was ignoring the `isFullImport` flag and processing keyword lists/preferences deletions on all saves
  - Previously, editing unrelated settings (systems, talkgroups, etc.) would delete ALL keyword lists and recreate them with new IDs
  - This caused user alert preferences to reference non-existent keyword list IDs, breaking keyword-based alerts
  - PostgreSQL auto-increment sequences caused IDs to jump (e.g., 41-44 → 53-56), orphaning existing user references
  - Now keyword lists and user alert preferences are ONLY processed during explicit full config imports (with `X-Full-Import: true` header)
  - Normal admin saves no longer touch keyword lists or user alert preferences, maintaining data integrity
  - Added automatic migration on server startup to repair existing orphaned keyword list ID references
  - Migration detects orphaned IDs and maps them to current keyword lists by position (maintains user selections)
  - Migration runs once automatically and tracks completion to avoid re-running
  - This matches the protection pattern already correctly implemented for users (which properly checked `isFullImport`)
  - Files modified: server/admin.go (lines 1246-1299 and 1302-1377), server/fix_keyword_list_ids.go, server/database.go
  - Prevents hundreds of users from losing their alert preferences when administrators make routine config changes

## Version 7.0 Beta 7 - Released TBD

### New Features

- **Opus audio codec support for 50% storage savings**
  - Implemented Opus audio encoding as an alternative to M4A/AAC format
  - Provides 50% storage reduction (16 kbps Opus vs 32 kbps AAC) with same or better voice quality
  - Opus is specifically optimized for voice/dispatch audio with superior low-bitrate performance
  - Storage savings: ~240 KB per minute (M4A) → ~120 KB per minute (Opus)
  - Bitrate: 32 kbps AAC → 16 kbps Opus (50% reduction)
  - Format: M4A container → OGG container with Opus codec
  - Voice-optimized encoding settings (`-application voip`, variable bitrate, max compression)
  - Configurable via `thinline-radio.ini`: `opus = true/false` (default: false for backward compatibility in Beta 7)
  - **Note:** Opus will become the default codec in Beta 8 (M4A/AAC will be deprecated)
  - Only affects NEW calls when enabled - existing calls remain unchanged until migration
  - Browser compatibility: Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari 14+ all support Opus natively
  - Mobile app compatibility: Android 5.0+ (99% of devices), iOS 11+ (99% of devices)
  - Web client: No changes needed - browsers automatically decode Opus via AudioContext
  - Mobile app: Added Opus/OGG format detection with magic byte checking (`OggS` header, `OpusHead` marker)
  - Files modified: server/ffmpeg.go, server/tone_detector.go, server/debug_logger.go, server/config.go, server/main.go, server/command.go, ThinlineRadio-Mobile/lib/services/audio_service.dart
  - Files added: server/migrate_to_opus.go, OPUS_IMPLEMENTATION.md, OPUS_CONFIGURATION.md, OPUS_MIGRATION.md

- **Opus migration tool for converting existing audio**
  - Database migration tool to convert all existing M4A/AAC/MP3 calls to Opus format
  - Command-line tool: `./thinline-radio -migrate_to_opus`
  - Batch processing with configurable batch size (default: 100 calls per batch)
  - Dry run mode: `-migrate_dry_run` flag to preview migration without making changes
  - Progress tracking with ETA estimates (~0.5 seconds per call processing time)
  - Error handling and retry logic for failed conversions
  - Statistics and savings reporting (shows total calls, converted count, size reduction)
  - FFmpeg Opus support verification before migration starts
  - Safe to restart - already-converted calls are skipped on re-run
  - Requires server to be stopped (migration runs on startup, then exits)
  - Configuration: `opus_migration = true` in INI file (set back to false after migration)
  - Files added: server/migrate_to_opus.go
  - Documentation: Comprehensive migration guide in OPUS_MIGRATION.md

**Migration Process:**
  - **Prerequisites:** Backup database, ensure FFmpeg has libopus support, stop server
  - **Step 1 - Dry Run:** `./thinline-radio -migrate_to_opus -migrate_dry_run` to preview changes without modifying database
  - **Step 2 - Migration:** `./thinline-radio -migrate_to_opus` to convert all existing audio files
  - **Custom Batch Size:** Use `-migrate_batch_size=50` for smaller batches (less memory) or `-migrate_batch_size=500` for larger batches (faster)
  - **Step 3 - Reclaim Space:** After migration, run `psql -d thinline -c "VACUUM FULL calls;"` to reclaim PostgreSQL disk space
  - **Step 4 - Verify:** Check migration with SQL query: `SELECT "audioMime", COUNT(*) FROM "calls" GROUP BY "audioMime";`
  - **Timeline:** ~15 min for 2,000 calls, ~45 min for 5,000 calls, ~3.5 hours for 25,000 calls
  - **Rollback:** Restore from database backup if needed (migration is one-way conversion)
  - **Important:** Update mobile app first and wait for 90%+ user adoption before migrating existing calls

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed keyword alerts not respecting alertEnabled preference**
  - Fixed critical bug where keyword alerts were sent to users even when they had disabled alerts for a system/talkgroup
  - Root cause: Keyword alert query was only checking `keywordAlerts = true` but missing the `alertEnabled = true` check
  - Tone alerts correctly checked both `alertEnabled = true AND toneAlerts = true`, but keyword alerts were only checking `keywordAlerts = true`
  - Now keyword alerts properly check `alertEnabled = true AND keywordAlerts = true` to match tone alert behavior
  - Users who disable alerts for a specific system/talkgroup will no longer receive keyword alerts for that combination
  - Alert preferences remain per-system/talkgroup - users can have different alert settings for different systems/talkgroups
  - Files modified: server/transcription_queue.go
  - Addresses issue where users reported receiving keyword alerts despite having all alerts disabled

## Version 7.0 Beta 6 - Released January 10, 2026

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed invitation codes not working for user registration**
  - Fixed `ValidateAccessCodeHandler` checking for incorrect status: was checking for "active" but invitations are created with "pending" status
  - Fixed `ValidateAccessCodeHandler` incorrectly treating unused invitations as used: database stores usedAt as 0 (not NULL), so added check for > 0
  - Fixed registration form not appearing when clicking email invitation link: auth-screen component wasn't setting `codeValidated = true` after successful validation
  - Users can now successfully register using invitation codes sent via email
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout invitation validation flow for easier debugging
  - Files modified: server/api.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/auth-screen/auth-screen.component.ts, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/user-registration/user-registration.component.ts
  - Addresses issue where fresh invitation codes were incorrectly reported as "already used"

## Version 7.0 Beta 5 - Released January 10, 2026

### New Features

- **Custom prompt support for Whisper transcription**
  - Added prompt field in Admin UI transcription settings (visible for Whisper API provider)
  - Administrators can now provide custom prompts to guide transcription with domain-specific terminology
  - Supports radio codes, phonetic alphabet, unit designations, medical terminology, and formatting preferences
  - Full backend support passing prompts through transcription queue to Whisper service

  - Tested radio dispatch prompt achieving ~95% accuracy included in Whisper repository documentation
  - Compatible with both local Whisper installations and OpenAI API endpoints
  - Files modified: server/options.go, server/defaults.go, server/transcription_queue.go, server/transcription_whisper_api.go, client admin UI components, whisper service

### Changes

- **Major tone detection improvements for analog conventional channels**
  - Implemented dynamic noise floor estimation using 20th percentile method for adaptive thresholding
  - Added parabolic peak interpolation for sub-bin frequency accuracy (improved from ±3.9 Hz to ±0.5 Hz)
  - Implemented force-split detection with lookahead confirmation to prevent false merges of distinct tones
  - Added bandpass filtering (200-3000 Hz) and dynamic audio normalization in ffmpeg preprocessing
  - Increased frequency merging tolerance from ±15 Hz to ±20 Hz to handle analog channel drift and Doppler effects
  - Dual gating system: frames must pass both global threshold (-28 dB) and SNR above noise floor (+6 dB)
  - Lowered base magnitude threshold from 0.05 to 0.02 (safe due to improved noise gating)
  - Frequency history tracking for better handling of slowly-drifting tones on analog channels
  - Significantly improves detection reliability on analog conventional channels with varying noise levels
  - **Note**: Tone detection feature is still in BETA - these improvements are based on user reports but have not been fully tested on analog channels by the development team (our systems are all digital)
  - Techniques and algorithms inspired by icad_tone_detection project by thegreatcodeholio (Apache 2.0 License)
  - GitHub: https://github.com/thegreatcodeholio/icad_tone_detection
  - Special thanks to thegreatcodeholio for developing icad_tone_detection and providing guidance
  - Files modified: server/tone_detector.go
  - Addresses community reports of poor tone detection performance on analog conventional channels
  - Community testing and feedback welcome to further refine analog channel detection

- **Whisper service improvements**
  - Renamed `whisper.py` to `whisper_server.py` to avoid Python import conflicts
  - Updated dependencies from `transformers` to `openai-whisper` for better prompt support and stability
  - Added proper hallucination detection and prevention mechanisms
  - Improved transcription quality for short audio clips and radio traffic

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed template compilation error in main component**
  - Removed reference to non-existent `talkgroupId` property in previousCall display template
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation error that prevented client build
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/main/main.component.html

- **Fixed talker alias ingestion not working**
  - Both ParseMultipartContent and ParseTrunkRecorderMeta now properly ingest talker aliases from uploaded calls
  - Added parsing of "tag" field from "sources" and "srcList" arrays in call metadata
  - Tag/alias information is now extracted and stored in call.Meta.UnitLabels
  - Existing controller infrastructure automatically adds/updates unit aliases in the database
  - Fixes issue where trunk-recorder and other upload agents could not provide unit alias information
  - Unit aliases now properly populate and persist in the units database table
  - Files modified: server/parsers.go
  - Thanks to community report for identifying the missing alias ingestion functionality

- **Fixed talkgroup sorting not persisting after save**
  - Fixed bug where manually sorted talkgroups would randomly revert to alphabetical order
  - Root cause: When SortTalkgroups option was enabled, code was modifying the actual talkgroup Order field in the database during config retrieval
  - Talkgroup Order values were being overwritten every time config was sent to clients (on connect, refresh, etc.)
  - Changed behavior: SortTalkgroups option now only affects display order without modifying database values
  - When SortTalkgroups is disabled (default): Custom sort order from admin panel is respected and persisted
  - When SortTalkgroups is enabled: Displays alphabetically by label without changing stored Order values
  - Manual talkgroup sorting in admin panel now properly persists across server restarts and client connections
  - Files modified: server/system.go

- **Added admin-configurable default tag colors**
  - Administrators can now set default colors for tags in the admin panel
  - Color priority hierarchy: User settings > Admin defaults > Hardcoded defaults > White
  - Users can still override admin-set colors in their personal settings
  - Admin colors are stored in the database and synced to all clients
  - Color picker in admin panel provides 9 predefined color options
  - Files modified: server/tag.go, server/migrations.go, server/database.go, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/tags/, client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/tag-color.service.ts, ThinlineRadio-Mobile/lib/services/tag_color_service.dart

- **Fixed P25 Phase II simulcast patch calls being dropped**
  - Fixed critical bug where Harris P25 Phase II patched dispatch calls were silently dropped
  - Issue: When dispatcher creates simulcast patch (TGID 64501-64599), system patches multiple talkgroups together (e.g., 1003, 6001)
  - Previous behavior: Call with patch TGID 64501 was dropped because 64501 doesn't exist in configured talkgroups
  - New behavior: System now checks patched talkgroups array and uses first valid configured talkgroup as primary
  - Call is now correctly associated with actual operational talkgroup (e.g., 1003) instead of temporary patch ID
  - Original patch TGID is preserved in patches array for search/display purposes
  - Eliminates need to manually add all 99 potential patch TGIDs (64501-64599) as workaround
  - All priority/emergency dispatch calls now properly recorded and displayed
  - Patched talkgroups are validated against blacklists to honor system restrictions
  - Three strategic checkpoints added throughout call ingestion process:
    1. Early check after initial talkgroup lookup
    2. Re-check after auto-populate creates new systems/talkgroups
    3. Final check before call write to prevent dropping valid patched calls
  - Compatible with Trunk Recorder's `patched_talkgroups` field format
  - Existing livefeed patch display logic now works correctly since calls no longer dropped
  - Files modified: server/controller.go
  - Thanks to user report for detailed analysis of Harris P25 patch behavior

  - Issue: When dispatcher creates simulcast patch (TGID 64501-64599), system patches multiple talkgroups together (e.g., 1003, 6001)
  - Previous behavior: Call with patch TGID 64501 was dropped because 64501 doesn't exist in configured talkgroups
  - New behavior: System now checks patched talkgroups array and uses first valid configured talkgroup as primary
  - Call is now correctly associated with actual operational talkgroup (e.g., 1003) instead of temporary patch ID
  - Original patch TGID is preserved in patches array for search/display purposes
  - Eliminates need to manually add all 99 potential patch TGIDs (64501-64599) as workaround
  - All priority/emergency dispatch calls now properly recorded and displayed
  - Patched talkgroups are validated against blacklists to honor system restrictions
  - Three strategic checkpoints added throughout call ingestion process:
    1. Early check after initial talkgroup lookup
    2. Re-check after auto-populate creates new systems/talkgroups
    3. Final check before call write to prevent dropping valid patched calls
  - Compatible with Trunk Recorder's `patched_talkgroups` field format
  - Existing livefeed patch display logic now works correctly since calls no longer dropped
  - Files modified: server/controller.go
  - Thanks to user report for detailed analysis of Harris P25 patch behavior

## Version 7.0 Beta 4 - Released January 3, 2026

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **Fixed email case sensitivity causing duplicate accounts and login issues**
  - Emails are now normalized to lowercase during registration and login
  - Users can log in with any capitalization (user@email.com, USER@email.com, User@Email.com all work)
  - Prevents duplicate accounts with same email but different capitalization
  - Added startup check that creates `duplicate_emails.log` if existing duplicates are found
  - Log file provides detailed information about duplicate accounts for manual resolution
  - Backwards compatible: existing accounts continue to work, duplicates logged for manual cleanup
  - Files modified: server/validation.go, server/user.go, server/api.go, server/admin.go, server/controller.go
  - Files added: server/duplicate_email_check.go

- **Fixed Docker image not reading environment variables for database configuration**
  - Added `docker-entrypoint.sh` script to properly convert environment variables to command-line flags
  - Docker image now correctly accepts DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS environment variables
  - Required environment variables are validated on startup with helpful error messages
  - Supports optional configuration: LISTEN, SSL_LISTEN, SSL_CERT_FILE, SSL_KEY_FILE, SSL_AUTO_CERT, BASE_DIR
  - Fixes "connection refused" and "database: failed to connect to host=localhost" errors when using Docker
  - Files added: docker-entrypoint.sh
  - Files modified: Dockerfile

- **Fixed Apache reverse proxy causing mixed content errors with HTTPS**
  - Updated example Apache configuration to properly pass X-Forwarded-Proto header
  - Server now correctly detects HTTPS when behind SSL-terminating proxy
  - Fixes blank page at root URL while /index.html worked
  - Fixes base href being set to http:// instead of https:// causing CSS/JS to fail loading
  - Files modified: docs/examples/apache/.htaccess

- **Fixed Whisper transcription connection failures**
  - Implemented automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries)
  - Enhanced HTTP connection pooling with proper timeout and keep-alive settings
  - Added connection pool configuration: 100 max idle connections, 20 max per host
  - Configured proper timeouts: 30s connection, 30s response headers, 90s idle
  - Improved error detection and logging for connection-related failures
  - Retry delays: 1s, 2s, 4s with automatic retry on transient network errors
  - Added detailed troubleshooting documentation (docs/WHISPER-TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
  - Fixes errors: "connection forcibly closed", "EOF", "wsarecv" network errors
  - Files modified: server/transcription_whisper_api.go, server/transcription_queue.go

- **Fixed dirwatch validation failure for default and dsdplus types**
  - Fixed critical bug where dirwatch configurations with `systemId` and `talkgroupId` would fail validation with "no talkgroup" error
  - Root cause: `ingestDefault()` and `ingestDSDPlus()` only set `call.Meta.*` fields, but `call.IsValid()` checks top-level `call.SystemId` and `call.TalkgroupId` fields
  - Now correctly sets both Meta fields and top-level fields when dirwatch config has systemId/talkgroupId
  - Includes overflow protection for 32-bit systems
  - Affects: dirwatch type "default" and "dsdplus" (trunk-recorder and sdr-trunk were not affected)
  - Files modified: server/dirwatch.go
  - Thanks to Dustin Holbrook for detailed bug report and analysis

- **Fixed talkgroup sorting persistence issue**
  - Fixed bug where talkgroup order would randomly revert after saving
  - Root cause: Display used sorted getter but underlying FormArray order wasn't updated during drag-and-drop
  - Now properly reorders the FormArray itself when dragging talkgroups, ensuring sort persists on save
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.ts

- **Fixed talkgroup access control not being enforced**
  - Fixed critical bug where group/user talkgroup restrictions were ignored - users could see all talkgroups in a system
  - Two separate issues fixed:
    1. Call filtering: `controller.userHasAccess()` now checks group talkgroup access, not just system access
    2. Config filtering: `systems.GetScopedSystems()` now filters talkgroups based on group restrictions
  - Group permissions establish baseline, user permissions can further restrict
  - Files modified: server/controller.go, server/system.go

- **Added "Sort A-Z" button for talkgroups**
  - New button to alphabetically sort all talkgroups in a system with one click
  - Properly updates both order values and FormArray ordering for persistence
  - Button disabled when no talkgroups exist
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/system/system.component.html, system.component.ts

- **Added toggle Select/Unselect All button for talkgroups in user groups**
  - Button dynamically changes between "Select All Talkgroups" and "Unselect All Talkgroups" based on current state
  - Icon updates accordingly (select_all vs deselect)
  - Provides one-click selection/deselection of all talkgroups when configuring group access
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/user-groups/user-groups.component.html, user-groups.component.ts

- **Added descriptive validation error messages in systems config**
  - Error messages now display next to red (!) icons showing exactly what's wrong
  - System-level errors: "Label required", "System ID required", "Duplicate system ID", "X invalid talkgroups", etc.
  - Talkgroup errors: "ID required", "Duplicate ID", "Label required", "Name required", "Group required", "Tag required"
  - Only shows specific validation errors, no generic messages
  - Files modified: client/src/app/components/rdio-scanner/admin/config/systems/systems.component.html, systems.component.ts, system/system.component.html, system/system.component.ts

- **Enhanced API call upload logging and diagnostics**
  - Added detailed stack trace logging for incomplete call data uploads
  - Now logs all call metadata when SDRTrunk or other sources send incomplete data
  - Includes: SystemId, TalkgroupId, Audio length, Timestamp, SiteRef, Frequency, Units, Patches
  - Also logs remote address and User-Agent for troubleshooting connection issues
  - Test connections now explicitly logged with test connection indicator
  - Example incomplete data log:
    ```
    api: INCOMPLETE CALL DATA RECEIVED:
      Error: no talkgroup
      SystemId: 12345
      TalkgroupId: 0
      Audio Length: 45632 bytes
      Timestamp: 2025-01-03 12:34:56
      SiteRef: 1
      Frequency: 851025000
      Remote Address: 192.168.1.100:54321
      User-Agent: SDRTrunk/0.6.0
    ```

- **Enhanced API key logging and diagnostics**
  - Added detailed logging when API keys are loaded on server startup
  - Now shows total count, enabled count, and disabled count
  - Added logging when API keys are saved: `Apikeys.Write: successfully saved X API keys to database`
  - Displays warning message when no API keys are found (upload sources won't be able to connect)
  - Example log: `Apikeys.Read: loaded 3 total API keys (2 enabled, 1 disabled)`
  - **Note**: API keys do NOT have foreign key cascade constraints, so they will NOT be automatically deleted when other data changes
  - **API keys ARE persisted to database** - they are saved via INSERT/UPDATE statements and loaded on every server restart
  
- **Enhanced device token logging and diagnostics**
  - Added detailed logging when device tokens are loaded on server startup
  - Now shows total token count and number of users with registered devices
  - Displays warning message when no tokens are found (helpful for troubleshooting)
  - Added deletion logging to track when and why device tokens are removed
  - Example logs: `DeviceTokens.Load: loaded 15 total device tokens for 8 users`
  
- **Device Token Cascade Delete Documentation**
  - **IMPORTANT**: Device tokens are automatically deleted when a user account is deleted
  - This is enforced by a foreign key constraint: `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - If users report losing device tokens after server restart/update, possible causes:
    1. User accounts were deleted or modified during maintenance
    2. Database was restored from a backup that didn't include device tokens
    3. Connected to wrong database instance (test vs production)
  - Device tokens must be re-registered by users in the mobile app after such events
  - Server logs will now clearly show: `DeviceTokens.Load: WARNING - No device tokens found in database`

  - Give friendly names to downstream instances (e.g., "Backup Server", "Secondary Instance")
  - Expansion panel header now shows: "Name - URL" or just "URL" if no name provided
  - Backend: Added `name` column to `downstreams` table with automatic migration
  - Frontend: New text input field in downstream configuration form
  - Makes it easier to identify and manage multiple downstream connections

### System Health Dashboard - Configurable Thresholds
- **Added configurable tone detection issue threshold**
  - Tone detection monitoring threshold is now configurable (default: 5 calls)
  - Previously hardcoded to 5 calls; now adjustable in system health dashboard settings
  - Alerts trigger when a talkgroup with tone detection enabled has threshold number of calls with no tones detected in 24 hours
  - Backend: Added `ToneDetectionIssueThreshold` field to `Options` struct
  - Backend: New API endpoint `/api/admin/tone-detection-issue-threshold` for getting/setting threshold
  - Frontend: New setting in system health dashboard with inline editing capability
  - Consistent with existing transcription failure threshold configuration

- **Enhanced system health settings section**
  - System health dashboard now includes three configurable settings:
    - Transcription Failure Threshold (alerts when failures exceed count in 24 hours)
    - Tone Detection Issue Threshold (alerts when talkgroups have calls with no tones)
    - Alert Retention Days (how long system alerts are kept before deletion)
  - All settings support inline editing with save/cancel buttons
  - Settings automatically reload after changes to reflect new values

### Tone Detection & Transcription Optimization
- **Tone detection now runs BEFORE transcription decision** - Major optimization to prevent wasting API calls
  - Tone detection completes first (typically 100-500ms), then decides whether to queue transcription
  - Calculates remaining audio duration after tone removal before sending to transcription API
  - Skips transcription if remaining audio < 2 seconds (likely tone-only, no voice content)
  - Saves significant API costs by avoiding transcription of calls that are 85%+ tones
  - Example: 8.1s of tones in 9.5s audio = 1.4s remaining → transcription skipped

- **Fixed tone duration logic** - Now respects user-configured min/max durations
  - Removed hardcoded tone duration thresholds (e.g., "Long tones > 3 seconds")
  - Now properly uses `MinDuration` and `MaxDuration` from tone set configuration for A-tones, B-tones, and Long-tones
  - Added `ToneType` field to track which type was matched ("A", "B", "Long")
  - More accurate tone detection based on user's actual pager settings

- **Enhanced tone removal before transcription** - Prevents Whisper hallucinations
  - Tones are removed from audio file before sending to transcription API
  - Eliminates transcribed artifacts like "BEEP", "BOOP", "doot doot", etc.
  - Uses ffmpeg `atrim` and `concat` filters to surgically remove tone segments
  - Preserves voice content while eliminating tone interference

### Pre-Alert System
- **Immediate pre-alert notifications** - Users notified as soon as tones are detected
  - Pre-alerts sent instantly when tones match a tone set (before transcription starts)
  - Allows users to tune in faster without waiting for transcription to complete
  - Pre-alert notification format: `TONE SET Tones Detected @ 3:04 PM` (includes timestamp in 12-hour format)
  - Separate alert type (`pre-alert`) created in database for tracking
  - Full tone alert sent later after transcription confirms voice content

### Pending Tone Management
- **Fixed unrelated tone sequences merging** - Prevents incorrect tone attachments
  - Added `Locked` field to pending tone sequences
  - Pending tones are locked when voice call starts transcription
  - New tone-only calls cannot merge with locked pending tones (stored in "next" slot instead)
  - Prevents race condition where unrelated tones merge during slow transcription

- **Added age check for pending tone merging** - Prevents stale tone combinations
  - Reduced pending tone timeout from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
  - New tone-only calls check age of existing pending tones before merging
  - If existing pending tones are older than timeout (2 min), they're replaced instead of merged
  - Prevents unrelated incidents from merging together (e.g., tones 3+ minutes apart)
  - Logs: `existing pending tones for call X are too old (3.5 minutes), replacing with new tones`

### Alert System Improvements
- **Fixed tone set filtering** - Users now properly receive only selected tone sets
  - Added extensive debug logging throughout alert preference chain (frontend → API → backend)
  - Fixed API to always store empty array `[]` instead of `null` when no tone sets selected
  - Backend treats `null`, `""`, and `[]` as "alert for all tone sets"
  - Mobile app (Flutter) and web client (Angular) now properly send tone set selections
  - Debug logs show: `user X has selected specific tone sets: [id1, id2, ...]` or `user X wants ALL tone sets (none selected)`

- **Enhanced alert filtering logic**
  - Pre-alerts and tone alerts both respect user's tone set selections
  - Clear logging when user is skipped: `user X SKIPPED for 'Brookfield' (not in selected tone sets)`
  - Clear logging when user gets alert: `user X gets alert for 'Liberty Duty' (selected this tone set)`

### Performance & Reliability
- **Optimized transcription worker logic**
  - Transcription workers now check remaining audio duration after tone removal
  - Mark calls as transcription completed if mostly tones (prevents pending tones from waiting forever)
  - Better handling of tone-heavy audio files
  - Reduced unnecessary transcription queue entries

- **Improved logging**
  - Added detailed logs for tone detection: `tone detection: analyzed X samples at 16000 Hz, found X potential tone detections`
  - Added logs for remaining audio calculation: `call X has sufficient remaining audio after tone removal (8.0s of 11.0s total, 3.0s tones)`
  - Added logs for pending tone lifecycle: stored, merged, locked, replaced, attached
  - Added debug emoji indicators: 🔔 for tone set matching, 💾 for preference saves

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed compilation errors in tone detection and alert engine
- Fixed pending tone timeout not being respected during merge operations
- Fixed transcription status updates for tone-only calls
- Fixed race condition in pending tone management during concurrent transcriptions

  - See migration guide in documentation for upgrading from MySQL/MariaDB
- **Dramatically improved call search performance** - Added composite index for 420x speed improvement
  - Added composite index `callUnits_callId_idx` on `callUnits` table for `(callId, offset)`
  - Reduced search query execution time from 23+ seconds to ~55ms (420x faster)
  - Fixed N+1 query problem in call search where correlated subquery was performing 201 sequential scans
  - Especially beneficial for mobile app call history searches
- Added automatic PostgreSQL sequence reset to prevent duplicate key errors
- Fixed sequence detection for case-sensitive table names (userGroups, registrationCodes)
- Sequences now automatically reset to MAX(id) + 1 on server startup
- Prevents duplicate key violations when creating new API keys, talkgroups, groups, tags, etc.

## Version 7.0

**Make sure to backup your config and your database before updating to Version 7.0.**

### Core Version 7.0 Features (Original Rdio Scanner Project)

- New database schema now compatible with PostgreSQL. 

**SQLite Support Removed:**
SQLite support has been removed in v7 due to fundamental architectural limitations that make it unsuitable for Rdio Scanner's production workloads, even in v6. SQLite suffers from:
- **Database locking issues**: SQLite uses file-level locking which causes frequent "database is locked" errors when multiple processes or concurrent operations attempt to access the database simultaneously. This is particularly problematic with Rdio Scanner's high-concurrency architecture where multiple clients, call ingestion, transcription processing, alert engines, and admin operations all need simultaneous database access.
- **SQL_BUSY errors**: Under load, SQLite frequently returns SQL_BUSY errors when write operations conflict with reads, causing call ingestion failures, search timeouts, and client connection issues. This was a persistent problem even in v6 with the simpler architecture.
- **Performance limitations**: SQLite is designed for single-user or low-concurrency applications. Rdio Scanner's real-time nature requires high-throughput database operations (hundreds of calls per minute, simultaneous client queries, alert processing, transcription storage) which SQLite cannot handle efficiently. The lack of proper connection pooling and concurrent write support creates severe bottlenecks.
- **No true concurrent writes**: SQLite only allows one writer at a time, which creates contention when multiple systems are ingesting calls, storing transcriptions, updating user preferences, and processing alerts simultaneously.
- **File-based architecture**: The file-based nature of SQLite makes it unsuitable for distributed or high-availability deployments, and creates I/O bottlenecks that proper database servers avoid through optimized memory management and connection pooling.

For production deployments, PostgreSQL is required and provides proper concurrent access, connection pooling, and performance characteristics needed for Rdio Scanner's real-time, multi-user architecture.
- New Delayed feature which allows to delay ingested audio broadcasting for a specified amount of minutes.
- New alert sounds that can be assigned to groups, tags, systems and talkgroups.
- New system and talkgroup types to help identify the radio system.
- Talkgroups can now be assigned to more than one group.
- LED colors can now be assigned to groups, tags, systems and talkgroups.
- Better call duplicates detection, thanks to the new database schema.
- Tags toggle removed in favor of multi groups assignment for talkgroups.
- AFS systems option remove and replace by system/talkgroup type provoice.
- Newer API while retaining backward compatility.
- Integrated web app migrated to Angular 15.
- Simplified talkgroup importation to a specific system.
- New /reset url path that allow reseting the user access code and talkgroups selection.
- New #UNITLBL metatag for dirwatch.

### BREAKING CHANGES SINCE V5

[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) is now distributed as a precompiled executable in a zip file, which also contains documentation on how it works.

The backend server has been completely rewritten in GO language. Therefore, all the subpackages used in v5 had to be replaced with new ones. These new subpackages do not necessarily have the same functionality as those of v5.

- No more polling mode for _dirwatch_, which in a way is a good thing as polling was disastrous for CPU consumption. The alternative is to install a local instance and use the downstream feature to feed your main instance.
- Due to the polling situation, the Docker version of Rdio Scanner doesn't have the dirwatch feature.
- Default database name changed from _database.sqlite_ to _rdio-scanner.db_. You will need to rename your database file with the new name if you want to convert it. Otherwise, a new database will be created.

- Some code refactoring.

_v6.0.5_

### Upgrading from version 3

- Your `server/.env` file will be used to create the new `server/config.json` file. Then the `server/.env` will be deleted.
- The `rdioScannerSystems` table will be used to create the _rdioScanner.systems_ within `server/config.json`. Then the `rdioScannerSystems` table will be purged.
- The `rdioScannerCalls` table will be rebuilt, which can be pretty long on some systems.
- It is no longer possible to upload neither your TALKGROUP.CSV nor you ALIAS.CSV files to _Rdio Scanner_. Instead, you have to define them in the `server/config.json` file.

> YOU SHOULD BACKUP YOUR `SERVER/.ENV` FILE AND YOUR DATABASE PRIOR TO UPGRADING, JUST IN CASE. WE'VE TESTED THE UPGRADE PROCESS MANY TIMES, BUT WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE IF IT'S GOING TO WORK WELL ON YOUR SIDE.
